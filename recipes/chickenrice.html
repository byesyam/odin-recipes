    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Khao man gai (ข้าวมันไก่) is the Thai variation of Hainanese chicken rice, a dish that’s extremely popular throughout Southeast Asia.</p>
    <p>In Thailand, specifically throughout Bangkok, you can’t walk more than a few blocks without finding a chicken rice cart or restaurant (same goes for Chiang Mai).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken</li>
        <li>50 g. Thai garlic (regular garlic will work too)</li>
        <li>About 3 tbsp. of fermented soy bean sauce (you can add more later if not salty enough, but it can be quite salty), if you can find the Thai version, that will be best)</li>
        <li>About ¼ - ½ cup of chicken broth, but more if it's too salty or too thick</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the garlic, and blend it up, or use a food processor. Alternatively, you can just mince it up as well. In Thailand they just use the full cloves of garlic, without even taking off the skin.</li>
        <li>While your soup is boiling, you can go ahead and add in as much salt and pepper to your tasting. It shouldn’t be too salty or too peppery, you’re looking for just a soothing broth.</li>
        <li>Transfer your blended sauce over to a pot or wok, and you want to just bring it to a boil for a few seconds - this is not really for any reason other than to kill any bacteria and make your sauce last longer (this sauce should last in the fridge for about 3 - 4 days, but of course it probably tastes the best when it’s freshest).</li>
        <li>Stir the uncooked rice and broth all around, even it out in the pot, and finally press cook on your rice cooker. Let the rice cooker work its magic.</li>
    </ol>
