    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One of the most famous of all Thai foods, and what I think is one the best soups in the world, is Thai tom yum goong (ต้มยำกุ้ง).</p>
    <p>What I love most about tom yum goong (ต้มยำกุ้ง) is the flavors of lemongrass, galangal, kaffir lime leaves, fresh Thai chilies, and fresh lime juice, that all combine to create a healthy and soothing broth that will light up your taste buds.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>300 grams of oyster mushrooms</li>
        <li>5 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>8 - 12 tablespoons of fish sauce (depending on your taste)</li>
        <li>10 Thai chilies</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Coarsely break about 10 kaffir lime leaves - no need to cut them, just tear them - which is going to help release their flavor.</li>
        <li>Throw the lemongrass, galangal, kaffir lime leaves, garlic and chilies into the water. You can put on the lid just so it starts to boil and release all the herb flavors quicker.</li>
        <li>Now prepare your shrimp (or whatever meat of choice you’re making tom yum with). Since I used goong mae nam (กุ้งแม่น้ำ), freshwater shrimp, I first chopped off all the tentacles</li>
        <li>Boil your tom yum for another minute or so and then turn off the heat. You don’t want your tom yum to be overcooked. The mushrooms and onions should be soft, and then it’s ready.</li>
        <li>Finally chop up a handful of fresh cilantro, throw it in the soup, and give your tom yum a final stir. The lime juice and cilantro taste fresher and more vibrant when not boiled, so that’s why I turn off the heat before adding them.</li>
    </ol>
